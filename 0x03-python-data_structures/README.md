> Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Intro

In this project, I learned about how sequence data types work in
Python - specifically, lists and tuples.

## Resources

1. [Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists)
2. [Data structures ](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
