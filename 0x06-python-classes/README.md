## Intro

In this project, I began practicing object-oriented programming using
classes and objects in Python. I learned about attributes, methods, and
properties as well as data abstraction, data encapsulation, and information
hiding.

## More info

### Documentation is mandatory

Each module, class, and method must contain docstring as comments see [example](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)
