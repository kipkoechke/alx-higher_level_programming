## Intro

In this networking project, I used `curl` in Bash scripts to send various types
of HTTP headers. In the process, I learned about how URL's work, domain names,
the many different HTTP request/repsonse header fields and status codes, and
how to utilize cookies.

Task six was an algorithm challenge separate from the overall project theme
completed in Python.
